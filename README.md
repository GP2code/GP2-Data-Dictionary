## Welcome to the GP2 clinical data dictionary repository!

This repo is the central, version-controlled source for GP2â€™s data dictionary.
It helps researchers and collaborators keep variables consistent, document updates transparently, and make sure everyone uses and references the most up-to-date GP2 standard format for clinical data.

## What's incuded?
You will find a .csv that can be browsed, downloaded for use in scripts/analysis, or you can make requests for additions!

## How to view the data dictionary
If you are solely interested in browsing the items to determine what modalities and variables are captured in GP2 clinical datasets, directly click on the .csv file in this repo. It will show a preview of the data dictionary and there are options to search the document or download the file directly! This is a useful resource if you are a site/data manager or PI interested in preparing clinical data for transfer to GP2.
